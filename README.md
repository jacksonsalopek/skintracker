# skintracker

## Prerequisites

1. [Bun v1.0.5+](https://bun.sh/)

## Getting Started

1. Link the `@skintracker/types` package:

```bash
cd ./packages/types
bun link
```

2. Install deps:

```bash
cd ../..
bun i
```

3. ... and that should be it!

## Running Locally

To run the project in development mode, run the following in your terminal:

```bash
bun dev
```

Alternatively, you can run the project in production by running:

```bash
bun start
```

This will transpile TS to JS and start the transpiled application.
