# skintracker

## Prerequisites

1. [Bun v1.0.5+](https://bun.sh/)

## Getting Started

1. Install deps for `@skintracker/types` and link the package:

```bash
cd ./packages/types
bun i
bun link
```

2. Install deps for other packages:

**@skintracker/api**:

```bash
cd ./packages/api
bun i
```

**@skintracker/client-web**:

```bash
cd ./packages/client-web
bun i
```

3. ... and that should be it!

## Running Locally

Running each project is relatively the same steps. Follow the code blocks to start each project locally:

#### @skintracker/api

```bash
cd ./packages/api
bun dev
```

#### @skintracker/client-web

```bash
cd ./packages/api
bun dev
```
